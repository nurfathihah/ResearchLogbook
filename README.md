# ANALYZING THE SMEs DIGITALIZATION IN MALAYSIA FOR BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY USING A SYSTEM DYNAMICS APPROACH
Abstract- The COVID-19 crisis has stressed the need to accelerate SME digitalization to weather the storm in the short term, increase resilience in the longer term, and "build back better." In response to the decreasing number of SME in Malaysia as a result of COVID-19, this research paper is developing an analysis of SME digitalization in Malaysia using a system dynamics approach model with the goal of increasing the number of SME that adopt digitalization in Malaysia over time. In the model, we refer to the dataset of SME overviews from 2019 to 2021 and are able to detect a few factors influencing SME digitalization, such as changes in customer behaviour, the COVID-19 pandemic, technology-skilled workers, training programs, government incentives, and digitalization awareness. In the same model, we also implemented two interventions, the first of which was increasing the percentage of digitalization awareness through government incentives and training programmes simultaneously. Meanwhile, for the second intervention, it involves increasing the percent of digitalization awareness and technology advancement adoption. As a result, we can see a major difference in terms of business performance by implementing the second intervention, which is digitalization awareness, government incentives, and training programs, which have shown increasing business performance compared to the real dataset in that range of years.

## Research Background
Digitalization is increasingly useful for small and medium enterprises to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Government and policy interventions can facilitate this process, and we suggest some steps that can be taken to support SME digitalization. The outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of the year has quickly turned the attention of businesses from continued growth and prosperity to survival.

## Problem Statement
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our former Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, enforced the Movement Control Order (MCO). Because of this, SMEs are struggling to survive because their operations rely on providing face-to-face customer service, which results in lost sales when a company closes. As a result, it motivates me to conduct a research study to tackle this problem. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on digitalization based on MCO adoption by SMEs.

## Research Question
a)	What are the significant factors that affect the SMEs digitalization during MCO?
b)	How can we analyse the relationship between SMEs digitalization and the identify factors?
c)	What are the best SMEs digitalization strategy that can developed (ii)


## Research Objectives
a)	To identify the significant factors that affect the SMEs digitalization during MCO.
b)	To develop a simulation model of SMEs digitalization to analyse relationship between identify factors.
c)	To recommend the best SMEs' digitalization strategy based on conducted intervention analysis.

## Scope of Study
This research will be conducted in Malaysia without considering the research participantsâ€™ age or gender. As for the time horizon of the study, the researchers will include the factors based on previous and current statistics and predict until 2022. The time is decided by considering the relevance of an era that does not have much difference from the current year, 2022.

## Significance of Study 
This research is beneficial to SMEs since it allows them to build a long-term business with a solid business strategy that is digitally enabled. Aside from that, to assist SMEs in resource planning and management during critical times. SMEs in Malaysia need to facilitate business, update old processes, speed up efficient workflows, boost security, and increase profitability.
